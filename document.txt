Overview: 
The Lox interpreter is made up of multiple Go packages that correspond to major parts of the Lox interpreter/language: ast, 
interpreter, parser, resolver, and scanner (I also included a shared package for error throwing).

To follow along with Go's package management, I created individual 'unit tests' for each package. However, the interpreter package's
testing follows a more end-to-end approach to make sure everything works overall. Go also tracks code coverage, so I tried to get
each package's testing to at least 75% coverage.

Finally, I created some example lox scripts to do some stress testing to make sure major functions of the lox language works like
control flow, functions, classes, recursion, and generic functions. 

Testing:
Each package contains a '_test.go" file that contains its test cases.

Shared Package - shared_test.go (100% code coverage):
    - `TestErrorAtSetsHadErrorAndPrints`
        - Input: call `ErrorAt(42, "Something went wrong")`
        - Expected Output: stderr contains `[Line 42] Error: Something went wrong`
        and `HadError == true`.
    - `TestReportWithWhereFormatsMessage`
        - Input: call `Report(7, " at 'foo'", "Bad token")`
        - Expected Output: stderr contains `[Line 7] Error at 'foo': Bad token`
        and `HadError == true`.

Scanner Package - scanner_test.go (97.7% code coverage):
    - `TestScanSimpleParens`
        - Input: `"()"`
        - Expected Output: Tokens `LEFT_PAREN`, `RIGHT_PAREN`
    - `TestScanNumber`
        - Input: `"123.45"`
        - Expected Output: Token `NUMBER` with literal 123.45
    - `TestScanString`
        - Input: `"hello"`
        - Expected Output: Token `STRING` with literal "hello"
    - `TestIdentifierAndKeyword`
        - Input: `"or foo"`
        - Expected Output: `OR` keyword, then `IDENTIFIER`
    - `TestCommentAndWhitespace`
        - Input: `"  // comment\n()"`
        - Expected Output: Tokens on line 2, verifying comment skipping
    - `TestUnterminatedStringSetsError`
        - Input: `"unterminated`
        - Expected Output: `HadError == true`
    - `TestScanOperators`
        - Input: `"! != = == < <= > >= /"`
        - Expected Output: Correct two-character and single-character operator tokens
    - `TestIdentifiersUnderscoreAndMoreKeywords`
        - Input: all reserved keywords and identifiers (`_foo`, `Bar123`)
        - Expected Output: Correct token types from the keyword map
    - `TestUnexpectedCharacterSetsError`
        - Input: `"@"`
        - Expected Output: `HadError == true` for unexpected character
    - `TestTokenTypeStringKnownValues` / `TestTokenTypeStringUnknownValue`
        - Input: Call `.String()` on each TokenType value
        - Expected Output: Correct string name for known values, "UNKNOWN" for unknown.

Ast Pacakge - ast_printer_test.go (81.8% code coverage):
    - Validate each visitor method (`VisitBinaryExpr`, `VisitUnaryExpr`, `VisitGroupingExpr`, etc.)
        - Input expressions: constructed AST nodes such as
            `(- 123)` → `(- 123)`
            `(+ 1 2)` → `( + 1 2 )`
            `(assign a (+ 1 2))`
        - Expected Output: Correct parenthesized string representations.
    - Additional coverage tests for `VisitLogicalExpr`, `VisitGetExpr`, `VisitSetExpr`,
    `VisitThisExpr`, `VisitSuperExpr`, and fallback paths in `Print`.

Parse Package - parser_test.go (88.1% code coverage):
    - `TestVarDeclarationParses`
        - Input: `var a = 123;`
        - Expected: Single `Var` statement with name `a` and literal initializer 123.
    - `TestBinaryPrecedence`
        - Input: `1 + 2 * 3;`
        - Expected: AST with `*` having higher precedence, represented as
            `(+ 1 (* 2 3))`.
    *Additional coverage includes `expressionStatement`, `function`, and `block` parsing.*

Resolver Package - resolver_test.go (83.1% code coverage):
    - `TestReturnFromTopLevelIsError`
        - Input: `return 123;`
        - Expected: Resolver sets `HadError == true`
    - `TestThisOutsideClassIsError`
        - Input: `fun f() { print this; }`
        - Expected: Resolver reports use of `this` outside class.
    - `TestThisInsideClassIsOK`
        - Input: Class with `this` in a method.
        - Expected: No error.
    - Plus additional tests for:
        - Shadowed variables
        - Superclass resolution
        - Duplicate variable declarations
        - Valid and invalid use of `super`.

Interpreter Package - interpreter_test.go (86.1% code coverage):
    - `TestArithmeticAndPrint`
        - Input: `print 1 + 2 * 3;`
        - Expected Output: `7`
    - `TestFunctionAndClosure`
        - Input: Function returning a closure and calling it repeatedly
        - Expected Output: `1`, `2`, `3`
    - `TestClassThisAndSuper`
        - Input: Classes `A` and `B < A` with `super.method()` calls
        - Expected Output: `B.method`, then `A.method`
    - `TestUnaryBangAndMinus`, `TestComparisonsAndEquality`, `TestStringConcatenation`,
        and runtime error cases (wrong operand types, calling non-callables, etc.)
    - *Covers all major interpreter branches.*



Stress Testing:
All scripts are in /examples

Scripts:
    - features.lox: Exercises all basic Lox features end-to-end.
    - control_flow.lox: Nested loops, if/else logic, summations.
    - classes_inheritance.lox:Tests class behavior, inheritance, `super`, and field updates.
    - functions.lox: Complex closure and recursion scenarios.
    - errors.lox: Expected error cases for invalid `return` statements.
        (Handled specially in Makefile to ignore non-zero exit codes.)
